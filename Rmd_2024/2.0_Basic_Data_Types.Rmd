R has a few basic data types (types of information/data), these are characters, numerics, integers, and logicals/booleans.

characters are enclosed in quotes like "apple"

what type of data is "hello world"?

numerics and integers can be used for calculations but strings or logicals/booleans cannot

what type of data is 3?

logicals or booleans are either TRUE or FALSE

what type of data is 3.14?


#assign the character "yellow" to the variable colorOne
```{r}

```

when you assign a value to a variable you should see it appear in the Environment window
