  Output: "welcome to the Data Frames Challenge Problems!"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "as always, this isnt required but is just more practice with the topics we learned!"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "for this set of practice problems we are going to use the ToothGrowth dataset"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "run this to access the dataset: TG <- ToothGrowth"
  CorrectAnswer: TG <- ToothGrowth
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr= "TG <- ToothGrowth")

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "get the dimension of TG"
  CorrectAnswer: dim(TG)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "dim(TG)")
  Hint: "the function for dimensions is dim()"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "view the dataset"
  CorrectAnswer: View(TG)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "View(TG)")
  Hint: "the function for dimensions is dim()"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "extract first 4 lines of TG"
  CorrectAnswer: head(TG, n=4)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr ="head(TG, n=4)")
  Hint: "the function for extracting the first few lines is head()"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "extract the last 3 lines of TG"
  CorrectAnswer: tail(TG, n=3)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "tail(TG, n=3")
  Hint: "the function for extracting the last few lines is tail() "

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "get the names of the columns of TG"
  CorrectAnswer: colnames(TG)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "colnames(TG)")
  Hint: "the function for column names is colnames()"

- Class: txt
  Output: "lets use our columns to do some analysis"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "calculate the median of len in TG, dont forget to remove NAs"
  CorrectAnswer: median(TG$len, na.rm= TRUE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "median(TG$len, na.rm=TRUE)")
  Hint: "check your coding help sheet or Google for the function"
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "calculate the mean of len, dont forget to remove NAs"
  CorrectAnswer: mean(TG$len, na.rm = TRUE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "mean(TG$len, na.rm = TRUE)")
  Hint: "check your coding help sheet or Google for the function!"

- Class: cmd_quesiton
  Output: "what was the lowest dose given in TG?"
  CorrectAsnwer: min(TG$dose, na.rm = TRUE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "min(TG$dose, na.rm = TRUE)")
  Hint: "check your coding help sheet or Google for the function!"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "what was the highest dose given in TG"
  CorrectAnswer: max(TG$dose, na.rm = TRUE)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = "max(TG$dose, na.rm = TRUE)")
  Hint: "check your coding help sheet or Google for the function!"

- Class: txt
  Output: "lets check these statustics against what R can provide us through the summary statistics"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "get some summary statistics of TG"
  CorrectAnswer: summary(TG)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr = 'summary(TG)')
  Hint: "the function for summary statistics is summary()"
