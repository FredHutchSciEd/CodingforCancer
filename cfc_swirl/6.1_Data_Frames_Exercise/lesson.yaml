- Class: txt
  Output: "welcome to the Data Frames class exercises!"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "lets practice downloading a data frame and importing it"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "before we download the data for the file, lets make the directory (aka a folder)"

- Class: txt
  Output: "the function dir.create('folder_name') creates a folder in your current working directory (the folder you are currently working in) called data"

  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "make a new directory called 'data' using the function"
  CorrectAnswer: dir.create('data')
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr="dir.create('data')")
  Hint: "fill in 'folder_name' with 'data'"

- Class: mult_question
  Output: "you should see a new folder in your Files tab named data, do you see the folder?"
  AnswerChoices: yes; no
  CorrectAnswer: 'yes'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="yes")
  Hint: "check the Files tab in the the Plots, Packages, and Help pane"
  
- Class: txt 
  Output: "now we are going to download the data from a website called Github"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: 'run this command, download.file("https://github.com/FredHutchSciEd/CodingforCancer/blob/2755efb71899ce4f1c0a2f12dd224280600e5ebf/clinical.csv", "data/clinical.csv")'
  CorrectAnswer: download.file("https://github.com/FredHutchSciEd/CodingforCancer/blob/2755efb71899ce4f1c0a2f12dd224280600e5ebf/clinical.csv","data/clinical.csv")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr= 'download.file("https://github.com/FredHutchSciEd/CodingforCancer/blob/2755efb71899ce4f1c0a2f12dd224280600e5ebf/clinical.csv", "data/clinical.csv")')
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: "did you download the data from Github?"
  AnswerChoices: yes; no
  CorrectAnswer: yes
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= "yes")
  Hint: 'go back and copy and run the previous command to download the data'

- Class: txt
  Output: "now that you downloaded the data, lets import it in to R and assign it to an object"

- Class: txt
  Output: "to do this we will use the read.csv() function"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "this function reads a file that is in a table format (like a spreadsheet) and creates a data frame"
  
- Class: txt
  Output: "you need to input the file you want it to read, in our case it's the clinical.csv file we saved in the data directory"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "use the read.csv() function, on data/clinical.csv, assign it to a new onject called clinical"

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: "use the read.csv() function on 'data/clinical.csv', assign this to an object called clinical"
  CorrectAnswer: clinical <- read.csv("data/clinical.csv")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr= 'clinical <- read.csv("data/clinical.csv")')
  Hint: "put 'data/clinical.csv' into the function as the argument"
