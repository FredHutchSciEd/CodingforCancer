# 1.0 Intro to R

The gray box below is called a **code chunk**. We use it to write code.

```{r}

```


To run your code chunk, you can the green play button (Run current chunk) on the top right corner of the chunk.
Let's try it here:
```{r}
print("Hello World")
```


## Using R as a calculator
```{r}
12 + 4 
```

```{r}
5 + 4 * 6 - 2
```


## Assigning variables
We use the `<-` operator to store a value to a variable.
```{r}
x <- 15
```

To see what `x` is, we call it by typing it out:
```{r}
x
```
Alternatively, we can look in the `Environment` pane to see all objects and its values.

Here is an example for assigning objects and using the objects to form a new object:
```{r}
apples <- 5
oranges <- 6

total_fruits <- apples + oranges
total_fruits
```
