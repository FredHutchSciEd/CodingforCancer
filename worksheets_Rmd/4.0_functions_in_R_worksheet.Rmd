# 4.0 Functions in R

We will start with a fresh, clean environment. 
The code chunk below clears your environment if you want to reset your work in interactive mode. Or use the broom button on the top right corner.

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
```


## Functions

**Functions** are commands that allow us to do repeat complex tasks or actions. 

Let take this vector as our starting example:
```{r}
ages <- c(10,25,20,14,60,20)
ages
```

We can use the function `length` to find out the length of the vector:
```{r}
length(ages)
```

We can use the function `mean` to calculate the mean:
```{r}
mean(ages)
```
